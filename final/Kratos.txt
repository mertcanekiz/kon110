He is usually portrayed as being oblivious to all else and arrogant in nature. He often engages in morally ambiguous activities and performs acts of extreme violence. A Spartan warrior, he became the "Ghost of Sparta" after accidentally killing his family due to Ares' trickery. He later avenges the death of his family and becomes the God of War after killing Ares. Kratos is eventually revealed to be a demigod and the son of Zeus, although Zeus later betrays him. Vengeance is a central theme of the Greek era, and each installment provides additional information about Kratos' origins and his relationships with his family and the Olympian gods. In the Norse era of the series, Kratos takes a turn for the good and finds himself controlling his rage and learning how to truly be a father to his new son, Atreus. Along their journey, they combat monsters and gods of the Norse realm, of whom they make an enemy.
